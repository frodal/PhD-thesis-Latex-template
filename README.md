A template for article-based PhD theses at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)

## Getting started

If you don't have a Github account I recommend you getting one and use version control when you write your PhD thesis. Version control with a Github repository gives you a reliable backup of your work and full overview of your working history, making it easy to revert back to or browse an older version.

### Download zip or create a new Github repository

* If you have a Github account, login and press the `Use this template` button to create a new repository based on this template

* If you do not have a Github account and don't want to have one, press the `⬇ Code` button and then `Download ZIP`

### Compile and build on your own PC

3. Open `thesis.tex` in Texmaker
