A template for article-based PhD theses at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)

## Getting started

If you don't have a Github account I recommend you getting one and use version control when you write your PhD thesis. Version control with a Github repository gives you a reliable backup of your work and full overview of your working history, making it easy to revert back to or browse an older version.

### Download zip or create a new Github repository
